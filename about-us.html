      <p>
        The Responsible Drinker was created to empower adults to make a lifetime
        of responsible alcohol choices as part of a balanced lifestyle. We aim
        to promote safe and responsible drinking while also also providing a
        list of new drinks to have fun with and enjoy.

        <p>Definition of Responsible Drinking: 
          Responsible drinking means more than just limiting yourself to a certain number of drinks. It also means not getting drunk and not letting alcohol control your life or your relationships.</p>
